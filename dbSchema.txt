Ideas for DB schema:

When a user creates an account, the following information will be needed upon 
account creation:

-Email
-Password
-First Name
-Last Name
-Pet Name

Once an account is created, the following will be saved in the database
-Email
-First Name
-Last Name
-Pet Name

we will NOT save the password. That will be handled under firebase authentication

After a user's account is created, we will add the following properties to each user

-Photo (Defaults to null, should be uploaded after the fact)
-Water level (int) (Defaults for now to 100)
-Food level (int) (Defaults for now to 100)
-isWaterDispensing (bool) (Defaults to 0)
-isFoodDispending (bool) (Defaults to 0)
-isCameraActive (bool) (Defaults to 0)
